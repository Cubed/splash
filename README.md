# splash
_Incredibly_ fast download/update tool.

0. Build or acquire a [prebuilt binary](https://github.com/polynite/splash/releases) for your system.
1. Run `splash -h` to see all available options.

## Common use-cases
* To download a [specific manifest](https://github.com/polynite/fn-releases), use `-manifest=<manifest id>`.
* To download only specific files, use `-files=<files to download>`.
